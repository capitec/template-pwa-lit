- `build` - Bundles code and copies artifacts for production from the `src` directory to the `dist` directory.
- `preview` - Launches a simple web server, serving the `dist` directory (Remember to `build` first! üéóÔ∏è).
- `test` - Launches the [Playwright](#run-end-to-end-tests-with-playwright) test runner & executes all tests within `tests` directory.
- `format` - Runs the Prettier formatter on all `.ts` files, applying format updates where necessary.
